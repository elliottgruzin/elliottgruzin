#### 📖 my tutorials

i love working in machine learning, but its easy to get too specialised, working in the same domains, with the same models. 

because of that, i've started a [repo](https://github.com/elliottgruzin/tutorials) where i put my self-guided learning in tutorial form. maybe it'll be helpful to you as well!
