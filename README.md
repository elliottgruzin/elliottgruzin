### ⚒️ some of the things i've done

  
    - **building chatbots from scratch:** <em>getting robots to talk to you</em>
    - **training generative adversarial models:** <em>making models that fight each other to get better</em>
    - **predicting conversational turn taking:** <em>giving computers social skills</em>


### my tutorials

i love working in machine learning, but its easy to get too specialised, working in the same domains, with the same models. 

because of that, i've started a repo where i put my self-guided learning in tutorial form. maybe it'll be helpful to you as well!
